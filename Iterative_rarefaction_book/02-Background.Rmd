__Rarefaction__ is the process of randomly subsetting samples so the total count values are identical across all samples.
__Rarefaction__ is intended to correct for bias caused by varying sampling depths across the samples to be analysed.

## Should you rarefy?

__Rarefaction__ can be a hotly debated topic with two main points of view.

1.  Some researchers believe it is not appropriate.
    1.  This is backed up by the 2014 paper ["Waste Not, Want Not: Why Rarefying Microbiome Data Is Inadmissible"](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003531)
    2.  Various R package developers do not recommend it such as the developers of [`phyloseq`](https://joey711.github.io/phyloseq/) & [`microbiome`](https://microbiome.github.io/tutorials/).
2.  Some researchers believe it is appropriate.
    1.  This is backed up by the 2022 paper ["To rarefy or not to rarefy: robustness and efficiency trade-offs of rarefying microbiome data"](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/38/9/2389/6536959)
    2.  The QIIME2 developers include rarefaction in their tutorials/SOPs for alpha and beta diversity analysis

We use __rarefaction__ in our analyses but it is ultimately up to you whether you utilise it or not.

## Using iterations

In our initial R community analysis workshop we only __rarefy__ once for each sample.
In this section we will __rarefy__ multiple times to calculate average values for alpha and beta diversity metrics.
This is __iterative rarefaction__ analysis.

This iterative approach will, in theory, smooth out any extreme results one round of __rarefaction__ may cause. Extreme results are possibly due the random nature of __rarefaction__.
These extreme results can include:

-   Leaving important features (ASVs, taxonomic groups, etc.) with no counts
-   Causing a few features to have much higher relative abundances
-   Varying alpha and beta diversity values with different sets of rarefaction

In this section we will learn how to:

- Use __random seeds__ for sampling
- Carry out __iterative rarefaction__ with sets of __random seeds__
- Use __iterative rarefaction__ to carry out alpha diversity analysis
- Use __iterative rarefaction__ to carry out beta diversity analysis
