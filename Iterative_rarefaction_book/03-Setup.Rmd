The data set we will use in this book is the same as that used in the [R community analysis workshop](https://neof-workshops.github.io/R_community_whqkt8/Course/02-Dataset_and_workflow.html#dataset).

Below are brief bullet points about the data:

- It is a 16S dataset of ASV counts with taxonomy and phylogeny produced by QIIME2
- The samples come from surface water from the Durance River in the south-east of France
- There are three sampling sites on an anthropisation gradient (low to high agriculture)
  - Upper Durance (UD)
  - Middle Durance (MD)
  - Lower Durance (LD)
- Four different media approaches were used to produce bacterial lawns that were sequenced
  - Environmental sample (ENV): No media used, frozen at -20째C.
  - TSA 10% incubated at 28째C for 2 days.
  - KBC incubated at 28째C for 2 days.
  - CVP incubated at 28째C for 3 days.
- There are three replicates for each sampling site and media combination (36 samples total)
