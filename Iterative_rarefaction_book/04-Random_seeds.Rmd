What are __random seeds__?

__Random seeds__ are numbers that computational tasks use to determine how they will carry out a random task.

In this section we will demonstrate the use of __random seeds__. 
This is to help understand what they are and why they are used.

## Random seed notebook

Create a new R jupyter-notebook called "Random_seeds.ipynb" for this section.

## Random sampling

To demonstrate the use of random seeds we will use the R function `sample()`. 
This function randomly samples a set of numbers.

Create the below code in a code cell.

```{R, eval=FALSE}
#Create a vector containing the numbers 0 to 9
num_vec <- 0:9
#Randomly sample 5 of these numbers
sample(x = num_vec, size = 5)
```

If you run the code you will get five random single digit numbers.

Run this multiple times and you will hopefully see the sampled numbers are different every time.

## Sampling with replacement

You may also notice that within each sample there are no repeating numbers.
You can change this by adding the option `replace = TRUE`.

Try this out in a new cell.

```{R, eval=FALSE}
#Randomly sample 5 of these numbers with replacement
sample(x = num_vec, size = 5, replace = TRUE)
```

Run this a few times and you will hopefully notice that the five numbers are not always unique.

When sampling __with replacement__ you replace each result back into the pool before sampling again.
When sampling __without replacement__ you don't replace the results.

The famous example is sampling green and yellow balls from a bag.
If you had a bag with 1000 balls and you wanted a rough idea of the ratio of yellow and green balls you could count the number of these balls within a sample of only 50.
Without replacement you would take out a ball, record its colour and throw it in a separate container.
With replacement you would take out a ball, record its colour and put it back into the initial bag, meaning it could possibly be recounted.

One advantage of sampling with replacement is that your sampling size can be larger than your actual population size.
For example, you could create a random sampling of 50 with a bag containing 10 balls with replacement.
This would not work without replacement.
The below script will cause R to produce an error saying "cannot take a sample larger than the population when 'replace = FALSE' ".

```{R, eval=FALSE}
#Randomly sample 15 of these numbers without replacement
sample(x = num_vec, size = 15, replace = FALSE)
```

Importantly for us __rarefaction__ uses sampling __without replacement__.
Any samples with a lower depth than the rarefaction size will be removed and will therefore not be in the resulting rarefied data.
