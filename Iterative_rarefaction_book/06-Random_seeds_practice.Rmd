Brilliant! To reinforce your gained knowledge try out the following challenges.

First create the following vector:

```{R, eval=FALSE}
second_millenium <- 1001:2000
```

__Note:__ Remember it is best practice to `set.seed(NULL)` at the end of a code cell.

## RSQ1

</center>

Sample the object `second_millenium` with the following parameters:

- Extract 10 values
- Without replacement
- Use the __random seed__ `489`

```{r, echo = FALSE}
opts_p <- c("__1120__", answer="__1369__", "__1744__")
```
What is the fourth number in the produced vector? `r longmcq(opts_p)`

`r hide("RSQ1 code solution")`
```{R, eval=FALSE}
#RSQ1
#Set random seed
set.seed(489)
#Randomly sample
first_answer <- sample(x = second_millenium, size = 10)[4]
first_answer
#Reset random seed
set.seed(NULL)
```
`r unhide()`

## RSQ2

</center>

Sample the object `second_millenium` with the following parameters:

- Extract 24 values
- Without replacement
- Use the answer to the first question as the __random seed__

```{r, echo = FALSE}
opts_p <- c("__1120__", "__1369__", answer="__1744__")
```
What is the 16th number in the produced vector? `r longmcq(opts_p)`

`r hide("RSQ2 code solution")`
```{R, eval=FALSE}
#RSQ2
#Set random seed
set.seed(first_answer)
#Randomly sample
second_answer <- sample(x = second_millenium, size = 24)[16]
second_answer
#Reset random seed
set.seed(NULL)
```
`r unhide()`

## RSQ3
<center>
![](figures/automobile.png){style="width:200px; border-radius:15px; background:white"}
</center>

Sample the object `second_millenium` with the following parameters:

- Extract a number of values equal to the answer of the second question
- With replacement
- Use the answer to the first question as the __random seed__

```{r, echo = FALSE}
opts_p <- c(answer="__1120__", "__1369__", "__1744__")
```
What is the 999th number in the produced vector? `r longmcq(opts_p)`

`r hide("RSQ3 code solution")`
```{R, eval=FALSE}
#RSQ3
#Set random seed
set.seed(first_answer)
#Randomly sample
sample(x = second_millenium, size = second_answer, replace = TRUE)[999]
#Reset random seed
set.seed(NULL)
```
`r unhide()`

Once you are happy you can save then close and halt your "Random_seeds.ipynb" notebook.

Through this section you have learnt:

- The use of random seeds for random processes such as sampling
- The difference between sampling with and without replacement
- How to set __random seeds__ in `R` for reproducible randomness

With this you can continue onto __iterative rarefaction__.
