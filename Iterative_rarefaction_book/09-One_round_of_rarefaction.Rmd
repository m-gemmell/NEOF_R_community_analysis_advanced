# One Round (1R) of rarefaction

Building up to multiple __iterations__ of __rarefaction__ we will first carry out one round of __rarefaction__ on our environmental pPhyla relative abundance data.

This will also allow us to compare the compare the results of no __rarefaction__ to only one round.

## 1R: Rarefaction
<center>

</center>

Carry out one round of __rarefaction__ and view the __rarefied__ counts.

We are using the environmental samples subsetted and phyla aggregated data.
Additionally, we are using the first of our __random seeds__ in `rng_seed_vec` and the minimum read count as our __rarefaction__ size.

```{R, eval=FALSE}
#One round of rarefaction
pseq_env_phyla_rarefy_1 <- phyloseq::rarefy_even_depth(
  pseq_env_phyla,
  #Minimum read count as rarefaction size
  sample.size = min(microbiome::readcount(pseq_env_phyla)),
  #First random seed as the rng seed
  rngseed = rngseed_vec[1])
#View count table
otu_table(pseq_env_phyla_rarefy_1)
#Sum count of samples
microbiome::readcount(pseq_env_phyla_rarefy_1)
```

You should see that all the samples now have a total count of __11046__.

## 1R: Relative abundance bar chart
<center>
![](figures/stacked_bar_chart_2.png){style="width:200px"}
</center>

Now to create a relative abundance bar chart with our __rarefied__ data to compare to our non-rarefied data.

__Note:__ This is not something you would do in real analysis.

```{R, eval=FALSE}
#Quick phyla bar chart of relative abundance
#Relative abundance transformation
pseq_env_phyla_rarefy_1_relabund <- microbiome::transform(pseq_env_phyla_rarefy_1, "compositional")
#Create, save, and display bar chart
phylum_bar <- microbiome::plot_composition(pseq_env_phyla_rarefy_1_relabund)
ggsave(filename = "./env_phyla_rarefy_1_relabund.png", plot = phylum_bar,
       device = "png", dpi = 300, units = "mm", height = 100, width = 100)
IRdisplay::display_png(file = "./env_phyla_rarefy_1_relabund.png")
```

Viewing the __non-rarefied__ and __rarefied__ based bar charts shows some differences. However, these are quite difficult to discern.

## 1R: Difference from non-rarefied
<center>
![](figures/histogram_1.png){style="width:300px"}
</center>

To more easily see the differences we will subtract the two relative abundance tables from each other.
This will produce a matrix of differences.

```{R, eval=FALSE}
#Value difference matrix
single_rarefaction_diff <- 
  phyloseq::otu_table(pseq_env_phyla_relabund) - phyloseq::otu_table(pseq_env_phyla_rarefy_1_relabund)
single_rarefaction_diff
```

We can see there are differences.
To make these differences even clearer let's make a histogram.

```{R, eval = FALSE}
#Histogram of differences
hist(single_rarefaction_diff, main = "Single rarefaction")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
opts_p <- c("__-0.0003(-3e-04) to 0.0003(3e-04)__", "__-0.003 to 0.003__", answer="__-0.015 to 0.015__")
```
What is the range of the differences compared to the non rarefied relative abundance values? `r longmcq(opts_p)`

Although these values appear quite small keep in mind we are working with relative abundance values.
Each sample has a total relative abundance of 1.00 so a relative abundance value of 0.01 is 1%.

Let's see if we can get these differences smaller with multiple rounds of rarefaction.
