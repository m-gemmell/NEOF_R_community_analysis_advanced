# $\alpha$: Iterative rarefaction loop

Now we will create averaged __alpha diversity__ values through __iterative rarefaction__.
We will carry this out by:

- Calculating initial __alpha diversity__ values from the first __iteration__
- Looping through the subsequent __rarefaction iterations__ and adding/summing calculated __alpha diversity__ values to the initial __alpha diversity__ values
- Dividing each value of the final summed __alpha diversity__ by the number of __rarefaction iterations__.

For this we will use the function `microbiome::alpha()` to calculate our alpha diversity values.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#Loop to create iteration based rarefied alpha diversity values

#Create data frame to contain final summed alpha diversity values
#In this case we'll run the first rarefied alpha diversity analysis
pseq_rarefy <- phyloseq::rarefy_even_depth(
  pseq,
  sample.size = rarefaction_size,
  rngseed = rngseed_vec[1],
  verbose = FALSE)
#Alpha diversity
alpha_df_sum <- microbiome::alpha(pseq_rarefy, index = "all")

#Loop through 2 to the number of iterations
for (i in 2:rarefaction_iters){
  pseq_rarefy <- phyloseq::rarefy_even_depth(
    pseq,
    sample.size = rarefaction_size,
    rngseed = rngseed_vec[i],
    verbose = FALSE)
  #Alpha diversity
  alpha_df <- microbiome::alpha(pseq_rarefy, index = "all")
  #Add/sum the new data frame values to the sum data frame
  alpha_df_sum <- alpha_df_sum + alpha_df
}
#Divide by number of rarefaction iterations to get average
alpha_df_mean <- alpha_df_sum / rarefaction_iters
#Save alpha mean data frame
save(alpha_df_mean, file = "alpha_df_mean.RData")
#Remove unneeded objects
rm(pseq,alpha_df_sum, alpha_df)
```

`r hide("verbose = FALSE option")`
We include the option `verbose = FALSE` in the `phyloseq::rarefy_even_depth()` to prevent a lot of text to be displayed.
This text says which rngseed was used in the rarefaction.
We don't need this message as we already have a record of the rngseeds we used in `rngseed_vec`.
`r unhide()`

You can check the structure and contents of our alpha diversity data frame with `head()`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
head(alpha_df_mean)
```

There are a lot of diversity metrics.
We are only interested in a few of them here but we will remove the other ones later on.
