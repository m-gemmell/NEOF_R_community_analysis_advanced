# $\alpha$: Plot and stats

In this chapter we will create a violin plot, similar to a box plot, to visullaise our metrics.
To detmeine if differences are significant we will then carry out Kruskal Wallis test and Paired Wilcoxon tests.

To visualise the differences of the alpha diversity values between the four different media we'll use violin plots.
We can use the function `ggplot2::geom_violin()` to carry this out.

Additionally, we'll add a point for each value and colour it based on the site it canme from (UD, MD, or LD).
The function `ggforce::geom_sina()` can be used for this.
We'll use its parameter `alpha()` to make the points 50% (`0.5`) transparent.

As we are plotting values from three different metrics we will split the plot into three separate plots.
`ggplot2::facet_wrap()` can be used for this tasked with `~metric` used to split the plot by the metrics.
We also specify `scales = "free"` so each of the three plots has their own x and y scales.
This is important when the values are drastically different such is the case between the observed and chao1 (>100) compared to the shannon values (<10).

`r hide("scales options")`
The four `scales` are:

- __`"fixed"` (default):__ All the scales are the same (fixed), based on the largest and smallest x and y values across all the plots. Useful where you want direct comparisons such as looking at teh overall pattern in ordination plots.
- __`"free"`:__ All the scales are free. Each plot's x and y values limits are based on the data within it.
- __`"free_x"`:__ The x axis is free and the y axis is fixed.
- __`"free_y"`:__ The y axis is free and the x axis is fixed.

Which you want to use depends on your data and how you are facetting it.
`r unhide()`

```{R, eval = FALSE}
#Produce ggplot object of violin plot
alpha_violinplot <- ggplot(basic_alpha_metrics_long_df, aes(x = media, y = value)) +
                            ggplot2::geom_violin() +
                            ggforce::geom_sina(alpha=0.5, aes(color=site)) +
                            ggplot2::labs(color = "Site", x = "Media", y = "Value") +
                            ggplot2::facet_wrap(~metric, scales = "free")
#Save ggplot2 object with ggsave()
ggsave(filename = "./Alpha_diversity_rarefy_iters_media_violinplot.png", plot = alpha_violinplot,
       device = "png", dpi = 300, units = "mm", height = 150, width = 250)
#Display plot
IRdisplay::display_png(file = "./Alpha_diversity_rarefy_iters_media_violinplot.png")
```

We can carry out statistics to compare the alpha diversity values between sample groups.

### Kruskal Wallis test

To determine if there is an overall difference in our data we'll use the Kruskal Wallis test.
We'll carry this out using the media grouping for our three alpha diversity values.

```{R, eval =FALSE}
#Kruskal Wallis test
#Observed ASVs
kruskal.test(observed ~ media, data = meta_alpha_mean_df)
#Chao1 estimator
kruskal.test(chao1 ~ media, data = meta_alpha_mean_df)
#Shannon diversity
kruskal.test(shannon ~ media, data = meta_alpha_mean_df)
```

All the p-values are less than 0.05 indicating statistical significance.
That means we can move onto pairwise comparisons.

### Paired Wilcoxon test

To determine what groups are significantly different from each other we can carry out paired Wilcoxon test.
This tests 

```{R, eval=FALSE}
#Paired wilcoxon test
#Observed ASVs
pairwise.wilcox.test(meta_alpha_mean_df$observed, meta_alpha_mean_df, p.adjust.method = "holm")
#Chao1 estimator
pairwise.wilcox.test(meta_alpha_mean_df$chao1, meta_alpha_mean_df, p.adjust.method = "holm")
#Shannon diversity
pairwise.wilcox.test(meta_alpha_mean_df$shannon, meta_alpha_mean_df, p.adjust.method = "holm")
```

You'll see three p-value adjusted tables with all the values (except Shannon: ENV against TSA) being significant (<0.05).
