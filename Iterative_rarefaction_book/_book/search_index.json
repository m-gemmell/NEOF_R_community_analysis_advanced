Gemmell 2024-07-11 Chapter 1 Introduction ADD NEW COURSE LOGO This book explains and demonstrates how to carry out iterative rarefaction for alpha and beta diversity analysis in R with the phyloseq object. This involves running multiple rounds/iterations of rarefaction and producing and averaged table of alpha and beta diversity values. This is a more robust method than only carrying out one round of rarefaction.

Rarefaction is intended to correct for bias caused by varying sampling depths across the samples to be analysed. 2.1 Should you rarefy? Rarefaction can be a hotly debated topic with two main points of view. Some researchers believe it is not appropriate. This is backed up by the 2014 paper \"Waste Not, Want Not: Why Rarefying Microbiome Data Is Inadmissible\" Various R package developers do not recommend it such as the developers of phyloseq &amp; microbiome. Some researchers believe it is appropriate. This is backed up by the 2022 paper \"To rarefy or not to rarefy: robustness and efficiency trade-offs of rarefying microbiome data\" The QIIME2 developers include rarefaction in their tutorials/SOPs for alpha and beta diversity analysis We use rarefaction in our analyses but it is ultimately up to you whether you utilise it or not. 2.2 Using iterations In our initial R community analysis workshop we only rarefy once for each sample. In this section we will rarefy multiple times to calculate average values for alpha and beta diversity metrics. This is iterative rarefaction analysis. This iterative approach will, in theory, smooth out any extreme results one round of rarefaction may cause. Extreme results are possibly due the random nature of rarefaction. These extreme results can include: Leaving important features (ASVs, taxonomic groups, etc.) with no counts Causing a few features to have much higher relative abundances Varying alpha and beta diversity values with different sets of rarefaction 2.3 Section contents In this section we will learn how to: Use random seeds for sampling Carry out iterative rarefaction with sets of random seeds Use iterative rarefaction to carry out alpha diversity analysis Use iterative rarefaction to carry out beta diversity analysis "],["03-Setup.html", "Chapter 3 Setup 3.1 Dataset 3.2 Conda environment 3.3 Diretory and files", " Chapter 3 Setup Include info on directory, copying data, and environment setup 3.1 Dataset The data set we will use in this book is the same as that used in the R community analysis workshop. Below are brief bullet points about the data: It is a 16S dataset of ASV counts with taxonomy and phylogeny produced by QIIME2 The samples come from surface water from the Durance River in the south-east of France There are three sampling sites on an anthropisation gradient (low to high agriculture) Upper Durance (UD) Middle Durance (MD) Lower Durance (LD) Four different media approaches were used to produce bacterial lawns that were sequenced Environmental sample (ENV): No media used, frozen at -20째C. TSA 10% incubated at 28째C for 2 days. KBC incubated at 28째C for 2 days. CVP incubated at 28째C for 3 days. There are three replicates for each sampling site and media combination (36 samples total) 3.2 Conda environment 3.3 Diretory and files "],["04-Random_seeds.html", "Chapter 4 Random seeds and sampling 4.1 Random seed notebook 4.2 Random sampling 4.3 Sampling with replacement", " Chapter 4 Random seeds and sampling What are random seeds? Random seeds are numbers that computational tasks use to determine how they will carry out a random task. In this chapter we will demonstrate the use of random seeds. This is to help understand what they are and why they are used. We won't do anything of value with the results in this chapter, instead this knowledge will be useful for understanding iterative rarefaction. 4.1 Random seed notebook Create a new R jupyter-notebook called \"Random_seeds.ipynb\". We will use this for this chapter. 4.2 Random sampling To demonstrate the use of random seed we will use the R function sample(). This function randomly samples a set of numbers. Create the below code in a code cell. #Create a vector containing the numbers 0 to 10 num_vec &lt;- 0:10 #Randomly sample 5 of these numbers sample(x = num_vec, size = 5) If you run the code you will get five random single digit numbers. Run this multiple times and you will hopefully see the sampled numbers are different every time. 4.3 Sampling with replacement You may also notice that within each sample there are no repeating numbers. You can change this by adding the option replace = TRUE. Try this out in a new cell. #Randomly sample 5 of these numbers with replacement sample(x = num_vec, size = 5, replace = TRUE) Run this a few times and you will hopefully notice that the five numbers are not always unique. When sampling with replacement you replace any results back into the sampling pool. When sampling without replacement you don't replace any results back into the sampling pool. The famous example is sampling green and yellow balls from a bag. If you had a bag with 1000 balls and you wanted a rough idea of the ratio of yellow and green balls you could count the number of these balls within a sample of only 50. Without replacement you would take out a ball, record its colour and throw it in a separate container. With replacement you would take out a ball, record its colour and put it back into the initial bag, meaning it could possibly be recounted. One advantage of sampling with replacement is that your sampling size can be larger than your actual population size. For example, you could create a random sampling of 50 with a bag containing 10 balls with replacement. This would not work without replacement. The below script will cause R to produce an error saying it can be done with replacement. #Randomly sample 5 of these numbers with replacement sample(x = num_vec, size = 5, replace = TRUE) Importantly for us rarefaction uses sampling without replacement. Any samples with a lower depth than the rarefaction size will be removed and not be in the resulting rarefied data. "],["05-R_and_random_seeds.html", "Chapter 5 R and random seeds 5.1 Setting the R seed 5.2 Reset seed", " Chapter 5 R and random seeds Sampling is meant to be random but true randomness is pretty much impossible, especially in computing. Therefore, many programs use seeds to determine how random tasks will be carried out. Various programs that use random seeds include: Sampling tools such as sample() and rarefaction Creating bootstrapped phylogenies Creating procedural content such as building Minecraft worlds 5.1 Setting the R seed To carry out random processes R uses a global variable called seed. The seed is normally random and changed every time it is used. This is useful for everyday analysis but what if you want replicable results? In R we can set the seed with the function seet.seed(). Carry this out followed by sampling. #Set random seed set.seed(1234) #Randomly sample 12 of these numbers without replacement sample(x = num_vec, size = 12, replace = FALSE) #Reset random seed (covered later) set.seed(NULL) You will get a result of \"9, 5, 4, 3, &amp; 6\". You can try to run the code multiple times and you will always get the same results. If you run a tool that uses random sampling you will always get the same results if: You use the same random seed (seed for R) You use the same data You use the same parameters including the replacement method (with or without) In fact, run the below code in a new code cell and you may notice a similarity with your previous output. #Set random seed set.seed(1234) #Create a vector containing the numbers 0 to 10 larger_num_vec &lt;- 10:19 #Randomly sample 5 of these numbers sample(x = num_vec, size = 5) #Reset random seed (covered later) set.seed(NULL) That's right, sample() will always take the 10th (9/19), 6th (5/15), 5th (4/14), 4th (3/13), and 7th (6/16) values if it is given the random seed of 1234, provided with an 11 length vector, and asked to sample 5 values. Setting our randomness is incredible beneficial for reproducibility in research. When you carry out analysis you may need to redo some work. This could be due to reviewer comments or you want to incorporate some new methods. As long as you saved the random seeds you used you can get the same results where you need to. It also means others can replicate your results. 5.2 Reset seed We set a random seed at the start of the cell for reproducibility and control, but why do we then run the line set.seed(NULL)? The normal operation of R means that, in effect, its random seed changes every time it is used. This means R normally randomly determines randomness. This is how it should be until we want to set the randomness. It is therefore good practice to set the seed to NULL after you have utilised your set seeds. This will revert the seed to its normal random operations. One last point to note is R versions. Version 3.6 changed R's sampling methods, therefore if you use Version 3.5 or below you will get different results than we have got. Hopefully the R developers will not change this in a later version again.

Through this section you have learnt: The use of random seeds for random processes such as sampling The difference between sampling with and without replacement How to set random seeds in R for reproducible randomness With this you can continue onto iterative rarefaction. "],["07-Iterating_rarefaction_intro.html", "Chapter 7 Iterating rarefaction intro &amp; setup 7.1 Iterating rarefaction setup 7.2 Rarefaction iterations 7.3 RNG vector creation", " Chapter 7 Iterating rarefaction intro &amp; setup In this section we will create code to carry out iterative rarefaction. We'll create a vector of random seeds, each used for a different iteration of rarefaction. We use this vector to loop through, using each random seed to carry out one iteration of rarefaction. In the next sections we will utilise this code to produce alpha and beta diversity values that we will analyse. 7.1 Iterating rarefaction setup First, create a new R jupyter-notebook called \"Iterating_rarefaction.ipynb\". At the top of this notebook create a code cell to load in the various packages and data we need. The code is below: #Libraries library(&quot;phyloseq&quot;) library(&quot;microbiome&quot;) library(&quot;IRdisplay&quot;) #Load processed but unrarefied data from R community analysis workshop load(&quot;phyloseq.RData&quot;) 7.2 Rarefaction iterations We need to choose the number of iterations we are going to carry out. For our practice we will use 10 iterations for speed. In your real analysis I would recommend using 1000 iterations. Let's create a variable for our number of iterations. #Number of rarefaction iterations to be carried out #Using 10 here for speed, real analysis should use 1000 rarefaction_iters &lt;- 10 7.3 RNG vector creation We can now carry out Random Number Generation (RNG) to create a number of random seeds equal to the number of iterations planned. #Create rngseed vector #Set seed for reproducibility #This number was chosen randomly set.seed(2605) #Sample 10 (number of iters) values from the number range 1-100,000 rngseed_vec &lt;- sample(x=1:100000, size = rarefaction_iters, replace = FALSE) #Print out vector rngseed_vec #Save our rngseed vector save(rngseed_vec, file=&quot;rngseeds.RData&quot;) #Reset seed set.seed(NULL) There are a lot of steps above. These are: Setting the random seed: We carry this out so we will always get the same rngseed vector that will be used for the rarefaction iterations. This is important so you will always get the same results if you need to rework some analysis, stats, or plots. Also useful here so you get the same results as the instructor and other attendees. Creating the rngseed vector: We use our old friend sample() to create a random number for each iteration we will carry out. We arbitrarily sample from the numbers 1-100,000, you could change this to a larger range in your future research. We use our previous object rarefaction_iters as size= to produce a random number for each of our iterations. We carry this out without replacement so none of our rarefaction iterations are identical. Save the rngseed vector: We save the vector as a file. We will load this in our alpha and beta diversity notebooks to be used for iterative rarefaction. This is also useful so you have a backup file of the rngseed vectors. Reset seed: Always good to reset the seed at the end of a Jupyter notebook cell or after it has been used in a Rscript.

We will carry this out by: Subsetting the data so it only contains the 9 environmental samples.

This will also allow us to compare the compare the results of no rarefaction to only one round. 9.1 1R: Rarefaction Carry out one round of rarefaction and view the rarefied counts. We are using the environmental samples subsetted and phyla aggregated data. Additionally, we are using the first of our random seeds in rng_seed_vec and the minimum read count as our rarefaction size. #One round of rarefaction pseq_env_phyla_rarefy_1 &lt;- phyloseq::rarefy_even_depth( pseq_env_phyla, #Minimum read count as rarefaction size sample.size = min(microbiome::readcount(pseq_env_phyla)), #First random seed as the rng seed rngseed = rngseed_vec[1]) #View count table otu_table(pseq_env_phyla_rarefy_1) #Sum count of samples microbiome::readcount(pseq_env_phyla_rarefy_1) You should see that all the samples now have a total count of 11046. 9.2 1R: Relative abundance bar chart Now to create a relative abundance bar chart with our rarefied data to compare to our non-rarefied data.

However, these are quite difficult to discern. 9.3 1R: Difference from non-rarefied To more easily see the differences we will subtract the two relative abundance tables from each other. This will produce a matrix of differences. #Value difference matrix single_rarefaction_diff &lt;- phyloseq::otu_table(pseq_env_phyla_relabund) - phyloseq::otu_table(pseq_env_phyla_rarefy_1_relabund) single_rarefaction_diff We can see there are differences. To make these differences even clearer let's make a histogram. #Histogram of differences hist(single_rarefaction_diff, main = &quot;Single rarefaction&quot;) What is the range of the differences compared to the non rarefied relative abundance values? -0.0003(-3e-04) to 0.0003(3e-04) -0.003 to 0.003 -0.015 to 0.015 Although these values appear quite small keep in mind we are working with relative abundance values. Each sample has a total relative abundance of 1.00 so a relative abundance value of 0.01 is 1%. Let's see if we can get these differences smaller with multiple rounds of rarefaction.

The final data frame is then divided by the number of iterations . This produces the final data frame relabund_phyla_mean_df. 10.2 Mathematical operators &amp; data frames Two numeric data frames/matrices can be summed together with + if they have the same dimensions. This can be carried out with any mathematical operator (+,-,*,/, etc.) An example of how this works is below. Note: You don't need to run the below code as the output is displayed. #Matrix 1 mat1 &lt;- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3, ncol = 3) mat1 ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 4 7 ## [2,] 2 5 8 ## [3,] 3 6 9 #Matrix 2 mat2 &lt;- matrix((1:9)*10, nrow = 3, ncol = 3) mat2 ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 10 40 70 ## [2,] 20 50 80 ## [3,] 30 60 90 #Summed matrix mat_sum &lt;- mat1 + mat2 mat_sum ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 11 44 77 ## [2,] 22 55 88 ## [3,] 33 66 99 If you only use one number with a data frame/matrix the operation will act upon each cell in the same manner. You could add 1 to each cell, minus 4 from each cell, etc. Continuing the matrix example, we'll get the average of the 2 data frames by dividins by two (/2). #Mean matrix mat_mean &lt;- mat_sum / 2 mat_mean ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 5.5 22.0 38.5 ## [2,] 11.0 27.5 44.0 ## [3,] 16.5 33.0 49.5 10.3 MR: Difference from non-rarefied We'll skip the bar chart this time and only look at the difference of the values. #Value difference matrix iterative_rarefaction_diff &lt;- as.matrix(phyloseq::otu_table(pseq_env_phyla_relabund) - relabund_phyla_mean_df) iterative_rarefaction_diff #Histogram hist(iterative_rarefaction_diff) What is the range of the differences compared to the non rarefied relative abundance values? -0.0003(-3e-04) to 0.0003(3e-04) -0.003 to 0.003 -0.015 to 0.015 You should notice that the differences are much smaller. This indicates that the structure of the iterative rarefied data is much closer to the non-rarefied data compared to the one round rarefied data. This is what we want.

Load the required data and libraries. #Libraries library(&quot;phyloseq&quot;) library(&quot;microbiome&quot;) library(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) library(&quot;IRdisplay&quot;) library(&quot;ggpubr&quot;) #Load processed but unrarefied ASV data from main R community workshop load(&quot;phyloseq.RData&quot;) 12.2 \\(\\alpha\\): Iterative rarefaction values Before carrying out iterative rarefaction we need to decide on a few values Rarefaction size: The sequence depth to normalise samples to We are using the minimum sample depth here The size you choose will be based on your data and what you feel is appropriate More info in the R community workshop RNG seeds: The rng seeds we will use for all the rarefactions We created these in the previous chapter Rarefaction iterations: The number of rarefaction iterations we will use We are using 10 here based on the length of our rng seed vector We recommend you use 1000 in your real analysis #Rarefaction values #Rarefaction size #Minimum sample depth in this case rarefaction_size &lt;- min(microbiome::readcount(pseq)) #Load the vector of 10 rngseeds created in the previous chapter load(&quot;rngseeds.RData&quot;) #Number of rarefaction iterations to be carried out #Based on length of rng seed vector rarefaction_iters &lt;- length(rngseed_vec) "],["13-Alpha_diversity_rarefaction.html", "Chapter 13 \\(\\alpha\\): Iterative rarefaction loop", " Chapter 13 \\(\\alpha\\): Iterative rarefaction loop Now we will create averaged alpha diversity values through iterative rarefaction. We will carry this out by: Calculating initial alpha diversity values from the first iteration Looping through the subsequent rarefaction iterations and adding/summing calculated alpha diversity values to the initial alpha diversity values Dividing each value of the final summed alpha diversity by the number of rarefaction iterations. For this we will use the function microbiome::alpha() to calculate our alpha diversity values. #Loop to create iteration based rarefied alpha diversity values #Create data frame to contain final summed alpha diversity values #In this case we&#39;ll run the first rarefied alpha diversity analysis pseq_rarefy &lt;- phyloseq::rarefy_even_depth( pseq, sample.size = rarefaction_size, rngseed = rngseed_vec[1], verbose = FALSE) #Alpha diversity alpha_df_sum &lt;- microbiome::alpha(pseq_rarefy, index = &quot;all&quot;) #Loop through 2 to the number of iterations for (i in 2:rarefaction_iters){ pseq_rarefy &lt;- phyloseq::rarefy_even_depth( pseq, sample.size = rarefaction_size, rngseed = rngseed_vec[i], verbose = FALSE) #Alpha diversity alpha_df &lt;- microbiome::alpha(pseq_rarefy, index = &quot;all&quot;) #Add/sum the new data frame values to the sum data frame alpha_df_sum &lt;- alpha_df_sum + alpha_df } #Divide by number of rarefaction iterations to get average alpha_df_mean &lt;- alpha_df_sum / rarefaction_iters #Save alpha mean data frame save(alpha_df_mean, file = &quot;alpha_df_mean.RData&quot;) #Remove unneeded objects rm(pseq,alpha_df_sum, alpha_df) verbose = FALSE option We include the option verbose = FALSE in the phyloseq::rarefy_even_depth() to prevent a lot of text to be displayed. This text says which rngseed was used in the rarefaction. We don't need this message as we already have a record of the rngseeds we used in rngseed_vec. You can check the structure and contents of our alpha diversity data frame with head(). head(alpha_df_mean) There are a lot of diversity metrics. We are only interested in a few of them here but we will remove the other ones later on. "],["14-Alpha_data_frame_tidy.html", "Chapter 14 \\(\\alpha\\) data frame tidying 14.1 \\(\\alpha\\): Metric and metadata data frame 14.2 \\(\\alpha\\): Long data frame 14.3 \\(\\alpha\\): Subset metrics", " Chapter 14 \\(\\alpha\\) data frame tidying In this section we will tidy up our data frame to make it ready for plotting by: Combining our alpha diversity values and metadata Converting our wide data frame to a long data frame Subsetting our data frame so it only contains the alpha diversity metrics we want to plot 14.1 \\(\\alpha\\): Metric and metadata data frame Now that we have our alpha diversity values we will create a data frame that contains these values and metadata. In the below code we extract the metadata from the rarefied phyloseq object created in the last loop iteration above. This ensures we only acquire metadata from samples that are retained after rarefaction. The samples that are retained are always the same across our rarefaction iterations as samples are retained based on the rarefaction size/depth which is kept consistent across our rarefactions. #Combine metadata and alpha diversity mean values into one data frame #Extract metadata from rarefied phyloseq object metadf &lt;- phyloseq::sample_data(pseq) #Ensure row names are identical #if not sort alpha data frame rows by metadata row names if (identical(row.names(metadf), row.names(alpha_df_mean)) == FALSE) { alpha_df_mean &lt;- alpha_df_mean[row.names(metadf),] } #Combine with cbind (column bind) meta_alpha_mean_df &lt;- cbind(metadf,alpha_df_mean) head(meta_alpha_mean_df) #Remove rarefied phyloseq object that we do not need any more in this notebook rm(pseq_rarefy) From the output of head() you should see a table with the first set of columns being the metadata columns. The next set of columns is the alpha diversity metrics. 14.2 \\(\\alpha\\): Long data frame We will plot our alpha diversity values with ggplot2 functions. Before we carry this out we need to convert our wide data frame to a long data frame. We'll carry this out with tidyr::pivot_longer(). For this we want our metric values to become long. This means that instead of the alpha diversity values being spread across multiple rows and columns their will only be one value per row. Two columns will represent these values in the long format: metric: The name of the alpha diversity metric value: The value of the alpha diversity metric #Create long version for plotting #alpha_df_mean (no metadata) column names to be used for long conversion alpha_div_colnames &lt;- colnames(alpha_df_mean) #Wide to long meta_alpha_mean_long_df &lt;- tidyr::pivot_longer(data = meta_alpha_mean_df, #Change the alpha diversity names to long format #I.e. keep our metadata columns as separate columns #all_of() used to silence warning message cols = all_of(alpha_div_colnames) #Set column name to column called metric #Set values to column called value names_to = &quot;metric&quot;, values_to = &quot;value&quot; ) #Change our metric column to a factor #Useful for plotting meta_alpha_mean_long_df$metric &lt;- as.factor(meta_alpha_mean_long_df$metric) #Check head and dimensions of long data frame head(meta_alpha_mean_long_df) dim(meta_alpha_mean_long_df) #Remove unneeded objects rm(alpha_df_mean, metadf) 14.3 \\(\\alpha\\): Subset metrics There are a lot of diversity values created by microbiome::alpha(). For this tutorial we are only interested in: observed: The number of observed features (ASVs, Phlya, Species, etc.) chao1: The estimated real total number of features diversity_shannon: The Shannon diversity metric An estimate of feature diversity based on richness (presence/absence) and abundance The higher the value the higher the diversity We'll subset our long data frame to only retain rows with these metrics. We'll also use the utility of factors to order the metrics so they are plotted in our preferred order further down. #Process our long data frame #Subset our long alpha diversity data frame to only contain our metrics of choice metrics &lt;- c(&quot;observed&quot;, &quot;chao1&quot;,&quot;diversity_shannon&quot;) basic_alpha_metrics_long_df &lt;- meta_alpha_mean_long_df[ meta_alpha_mean_long_df$metric %in% metrics, ] #Change instances of diversity_shannon to shannon basic_alpha_metrics_long_df$metric &lt;- gsub(pattern = &quot;diversity_shannon&quot;, replacement = &quot;shannon&quot;, x = basic_alpha_metrics_long_df$metric) #The gsub() function changes our factor to a character vector #Therefore change back to factor #We will also choose our order of the metric names for plotting basic_alpha_metrics_long_df$metric &lt;- factor(x = basic_alpha_metrics_long_df$metric, levels = c(&quot;observed&quot;,&quot;chao1&quot;,&quot;shannon&quot;)) #Check level order of metric factor column levels(basic_alpha_metrics_long_df$metric) #Check head of subsetted long data frame head(basic_alpha_metrics_long_df) With this data frame we can move onto visualisation and statistics. "],["15-Alpha_violin_plot_and_stats.html", "Chapter 15 \\(\\alpha\\): Violin plot and stats 15.1 \\(\\alpha\\): Violin plot 15.2 \\(\\alpha\\): Stats", " Chapter 15 \\(\\alpha\\): Violin plot and stats In this chapter we will create a violin plot, similar to a box plot, to visullaise our metrics. To detmeine if differences are significant we will then carry out Kruskal Wallis test and Paired Wilcoxon tests. 15.1 \\(\\alpha\\): Violin plot To visualise the differences of the alpha diversity values between the four different media we'll use violin plots. We can use the function ggplot2::geom_violin() to carry this out. Additionally, we'll add a point for each value and colour it based on the site it canme from (UD, MD, or LD). The function ggforce::geom_sina() can be used for this. We'll use its parameter alpha() to make the points 50% (0.5) transparent. As we are plotting values from three different metrics we will split the plot into three separate plots. ggplot2::facet_wrap() can be used for this tasked with ~metric used to split the plot by the metrics. We also specify scales = \"free\" so each of the three plots has their own x and y scales. This is important when the values are drastically different such is the case between the observed and chao1 (&gt;100) compared to the shannon values (&lt;10). scales options The four scales are: \"fixed\" (default): All the scales are the same (fixed), based on the largest and smallest x and y values across all the plots. Useful where you want direct comparisons such as looking at teh overall pattern in ordination plots. \"free\": All the scales are free. Each plot's x and y values limits are based on the data within it. \"free_x\": The x axis is free and the y axis is fixed. \"free_y\": The y axis is free and the x axis is fixed. Which you want to use depends on your data and how you are facetting it. 15.2 \\(\\alpha\\): Stats We can carry out statistics to compare the alpha diversity values between sample groups. 15.2.1 Kruskal Wallis test To determine if there is an overall difference in our data we'll use the Kruskal Wallis test. We'll carry this out using the media grouping for our three alpha diversity values. #Kruskal Wallis test #Observed ASVs kruskal.test(observed ~ media, data = meta_alpha_mean_df) #Chao1 estimator kruskal.test(chao1 ~ media, data = meta_alpha_mean_df) #Shannon diversity kruskal.test(shannon ~ media, data = meta_alpha_mean_df) All the p-values are less than 0.05 indicating statistical significance. That means we can move onto pairwise comparisons. 15.2.2 Paired Wilcoxon test To determine what groups are significantly different from each other we can carry out paired Wilcoxon test. This tests #Paired wilcoxon test #Observed ASVs pairwise.wilcox.test(meta_alpha_mean_df$observed, meta_alpha_mean_df, p.adjust.method = &quot;holm&quot;) #Chao1 estimator pairwise.wilcox.test(meta_alpha_mean_df$chao1, meta_alpha_mean_df, p.adjust.method = &quot;holm&quot;) #Shannon diversity pairwise.wilcox.test(meta_alpha_mean_df$shannon, meta_alpha_mean_df, p.adjust.method = &quot;holm&quot;) You'll see three p-value adjusted tables with all the values (except Shannon: ENV against TSA) being significant (&lt;0.05). #Produce ggplot object of violin plot alpha_violinplot &lt;- ggplot(basic_alpha_metrics_long_df, aes(x = media, y = value)) + ggplot2::geom_violin() + ggforce::geom_sina(alpha=0.5, aes(color=site)) + ggplot2::labs(color = &quot;Site&quot;, x = &quot;Media&quot;, y = &quot;Value&quot;) + ggplot2::facet_wrap(~metric, scales = &quot;free&quot;) #Save ggplot2 object with ggsave() ggsave(filename = &quot;./Alpha_diversity_rarefy_iters_media_violinplot.png&quot;, plot = alpha_violinplot, device = &quot;png&quot;, dpi = 300, units = &quot;mm&quot;, height = 150, width = 250) #Display plot IRdisplay::display_png(file = &quot;./Alpha_diversity_rarefy_iters_media_violinplot.png&quot;) "],["16-Alpha_plot_with_stats.html", "Chapter 16 \\(\\alpha\\): Plot with stats 16.1 List of comparisons 16.2 Violin plot with stats 16.3 Reorder x-axis and stats", " Chapter 16 \\(\\alpha\\): Plot with stats Rather than having the plot and stats separate, we can add stats onto our plot. This can be carried out with the function stat_compare_means() from the `ggpubr package. 16.1 List of comparisons To produce pairwise comparisons with ggpubr::stat_compare_means() we need a list of the comparisons we want to carry out. We can create this with the function combn(), short for combination. We provide it with three parameters: Input data: This is a vector of the unique metadata categories to create the combinations from We are using our created uniq_media_values_chr_vec in this case We ensure that this is a vector of characters so the created combination list contains character vectors A list of character vectors is required for ggpubr::stat_compare_means() m =: The number of elements to choose when creating combinations. We choose 2 so we get all pair combinations simplify =: Indicates if the result should be simple (TRUE) or not (FALSE) TRUE returns a simplified array such as a matrix or a data frame FALSE returns a list. This is what we want as ggpubr::stat_compare_means() requires a list #To compare mean we need to create a list of comparisons #Create character vector of unique metadata values (media in this case) uniq_media_values_chr_vec &lt;- unique(as.character(basic_alpha_metrics_long_df$media)) uniq_media_values_chr_vec #Can use combn() to get comparisons my_comparisons &lt;- combn(uniq_media_values_chr_vec, m = 2, simplify = FALSE)) #Check contents and structure my_comparisons str(my_comparisons) 16.2 Violin plot with stats With our list of comparisons we can add ggpubr::stat_compare_means() to our ggplot2 code. This function will both calculate the Wilcoxon tests and add them to the plot. #Produce ggplot object of violin plot alpha_violinplot &lt;- ggplot(basic_alpha_metrics_long_df, aes(x = media, y = value)) + ggplot2::geom_violin() + ggforce::geom_sina(alpha=0.5, aes(color=site)) + ggplot2::labs(color = &quot;Site&quot;, x = &quot;Media&quot;, y = &quot;Value&quot;) + ggplot2::facet_wrap(~metric, scales = &quot;free&quot;) + #Add comparisons ggpubr::stat_compare_means(comparisons = my_comparisons) #Save ggplot2 object with ggsave() ggsave(filename = &quot;./Alpha_diversity_rarefy_iters_media_violinplot_pairwise_wilcox.png&quot;, plot = alpha_violinplot, device = &quot;png&quot;, dpi = 300, units = &quot;mm&quot;, height = 150, width = 250) #Display plot IRdisplay::display_png(file = &quot;./Alpha_diversity_rarefy_iters_media_violinplot_pairwise_wilcox.png&quot;) 16.3 Reorder x-axis and stats ggplot orders the x-axis by alphabetical order. This is not normally wanted so we will convert our media column to a factor and order the levels how we want them. As the environmental samples can be seen as the baseline we will have them first. #Set order of media basic_alpha_metrics_long_df$media &lt;- factor(basic_alpha_metrics_long_df$media, #Set order of levels levels = c(&quot;ENV&quot;, &quot;CVP&quot;, &quot;KBC&quot;, &quot;TSA&quot;)) The stats in our previous plot were also not in a good order. We'll therefore reorder them. When doing this it is important to note that the first comparison in the lists is the bottom most stat in the plot. #Order comparisons my_ordered_comparisons &lt;- my_comparisons[c(1,2,6,4,3,5)] my_ordered_comparisons You'll notice this can be quite manual. It can be made easier when doing this yourself to roughly reorder, run the below code for your plot, then fix the stats reorder. With our media categories and comparisons reordered we can create the final plot. #Produce ggplot object of violin plot alpha_violinplot &lt;- ggplot(basic_alpha_metrics_long_df, aes(x = media, y = value)) + ggplot2::geom_violin() + ggforce::geom_sina(alpha=0.5, aes(color=site)) + ggplot2::labs(color = &quot;Site&quot;, x = &quot;Media&quot;, y = &quot;Value&quot;) + ggplot2::facet_wrap(~metric, scales = &quot;free&quot;) + #Add comparisons ggpubr::stat_compare_means(comparisons = my_ordered_comparisons) #Save ggplot2 object with ggsave() ggsave(filename = &quot;./Alpha_diversity_rarefy_iters_media_violinplot_pairwise_wilcox.png&quot;, plot = alpha_violinplot, device = &quot;png&quot;, dpi = 300, units = &quot;mm&quot;, height = 150, width = 250) #Display plot IRdisplay::display_png(file = &quot;./Alpha_diversity_rarefy_iters_media_violinplot_pairwise_wilcox.png&quot;) "],["17-Alpha_diversity_practice.html", "Chapter 17 \\(\\alpha\\): Practice 17.1 \\(\\alpha\\): Task 17.2 \\(\\alpha\\): Recap", " Chapter 17 \\(\\alpha\\): Practice 17.1 \\(\\alpha\\): Task As an optional task create a new violin plot that includes the following: Plots the metrics: \"chao1\" \"evenness_pielou\" renaming it as \"pielou\" \"diversity_fisher\" renaming it as \"fisher\" Ensure they are in the order \"chao1\", \"pielou\", then \"fisher\" The x-axis is separated by Site (UD, MD, LD) rather than media.
