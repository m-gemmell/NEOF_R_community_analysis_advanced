Prior to any analysis we need to setup our environment in the webVNC.

## Logon instructions {#cluster}

For this workshop we will be using Virtual Network Computing (VNC). Connect to the VNC with a browser by using the webVNC link you were sent.

You will now be in a logged-in Linux VNC desktop. 
You will see something as below (there may be only one terminal which is fine). 
If you do not see something similar please ask for assistance.

If the VNC is taking up too much/little space of your browser you can use the zoom of your browser to adjust the size. 
You will most likely need to use your browser's tool bar to accomplish this. 
Ensure you can see the grey borders.

These instructions will not work outside of this workshop. 
If you would like to install your own Linux OS on your desktop or laptop we would recommend Mint Linux 

The following link is a guide to install Mint Linux:

## Mamba

This workshop requires a lot of packages. 
These all can be difficult to install with R. 
Instead we have used Mamba forge to install R, its packages, and Jupyter-notebook (more info below). 
To learn more about Mamba-forge and how to create your own environment please see the [appendix](#mamba_install).

To set-up your environment for this workshop please run the following code (you must include the full stop and space at the front of the command).

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
. usercommunity
```

You will have successfully activated the environment if you now see `(r_community)` at the start of your command prompt. 
This indicates you are now in the mamba environment called `r_community` created by the instructor.

If you are interested in the use script you can look at its contents.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
less /usr/local/bin/usercommunity
```

__Tip:__ press `q` to quit `less`.

For more about mamba and how to create your own `r_community` environment please see the [appendix](#mamba_install)
