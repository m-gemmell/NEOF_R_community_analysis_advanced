Rarefaction is the process of randomly subsetting samples so the total count values are identical across all samples.
Rarefaction is intended to correct for bias caused by varying sampling depths across the samples to be analysed.

## Should you rarefy?

Rarefaction can be a hotly debated topic with two main points of view.

1.  Some researchers believe it is not appropriate.
    1.  This is backed up by the 2014 paper ["Waste Not, Want Not: Why Rarefying Microbiome Data Is Inadmissible"](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003531)
    2.  Various R package developers do not recommend it such as the developers of [`phyloseq`](https://joey711.github.io/phyloseq/) & [`microbiome`](https://microbiome.github.io/tutorials/).
2.  Some researchers believe it is appropriate.
    1.  This is backed up by the 2022 paper ["To rarefy or not to rarefy: robustness and efficiency trade-offs of rarefying microbiome data"](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/38/9/2389/6536959)
    2.  The QIIME2 developers include rarefaction in their tutorials/SOPs for alpha and beta diversity analysis

We use rarefaction in our analyses but it is ultimately up to you whether you utilise it or not.

## Using iterations

In our initial R community analysis workshop we only rarefy once for each sample.
In this section we will rarefy multiple times to calculate average values for alpha and beta diversity metrics.
This is an iterative rarefaction analysis.

This iterative approach will, in theory, smooth out any extreme results one round of rarefaction may cause, Extreme results being possibly due the random nature of rarefaction.
These extreme results can include:

-   Leaving important features (ASVs, taxonomic groups, etc.) with no counts
-   Causing a few features to have much higher relative abundances than
-   Varying alpha and beta diversity values with different sets of rarefaction

## Section contents

CHECK below sentence

In this section we will learn how to:

- Use random seeds for sampling
- Carry out iterative rarefaction with sets of random seeds
- Use iterative rarefaction to carry out alpha diversity analysis
- Use iterative rarefaction to carry out beta diversity analysis
