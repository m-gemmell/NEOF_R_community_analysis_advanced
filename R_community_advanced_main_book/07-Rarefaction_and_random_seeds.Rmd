What are random seeds?

Random seeds are numbers that computational tasks use to determine how they will carry out a random task.

In this chapter we will demonstrate the use of random seeds. 
This is to help understand what they are and why they are used.
We won't do anything of value with the results in this chapter, instead this knowledge will be useful for understanding iterative rarefaction.

## Random seed notebook

<center>
![](figures/seed_notebook.png){style="width:100px"}
</center>

Create a new R jupyter-notebook called "Random_seeds.ipynb".
We will use this for this chapter.

## Random sampling
<center>
![](figures/random_sampling.png){style="width:200px; background:white; border-radius:5px"}
</center>

To demonstrate this we will use the R function `sample()`. 
This function randomly samples a set of numbers.

Create the below code in a code cell.

```{R, eval=FALSE}
#Create a vector containing the numbers 0 to 10
num_vec <- 0:10
#Randomly sample 5 of these numbers
sample(x = num_vec, size = 5)
```

If you run the code you will get five random single digit numbers.

Run this multiple times and you will hopefully see the sampled numbers are different every time.

## Sampling with replacement
<center>
![](figures/balls.png){style="width:200px"}
</center>

You may also notice that within each sample there are no repeating numbers.
You can change this by adding the options `replace = TRUE`.

Try this out in a new cell.

```{R, eval=FALSE}
#Randomly sample 5 of these numbers with replacement
sample(x = num_vec, size = 5, replace = TRUE)
```

Run this a few times and you will hopefully notice that there are repeats.

When sampling with replacement you put back any results back into the sampling pool.
When sampling without replacement you don't put back any results into the sampling pool.

The famous example is sampling green and yellow balls from a bag.
If you had a bag with 1000 balls and you wanted a rough idea of the ratio of yellow and green balls you could count the number of these balls of only 50.
Without replacement you would take out a ball, mark its colour and throw it in a separate container.
With replacement you would take out a ball, mark its colour and put it back into the intial bag, meanig it could possibly be recounted.

One advantage of sampling with replacement is that your sampling size can be larger than your actual population size.
For example, you could create a random sampling of 50 with a bag containing 10 balls with replacement.
This would not work without replacement.
The below script will cause R to produce an error saying it can be done with replacement.

```{R, eval=FALSE}
#Randomly sample 5 of these numbers with replacement
sample(x = num_vec, size = 5, replace = TRUE)
```

Importantly for us rarefaction uses sampling without replacement.

## Setting a random seed
<center>
![](figures/set_a_seed.png){style="width:400px"}
</center>

We'll sample, without replacement, the numbers one more time in a new cell.
However, this time we will set the random seed with the function `seet.seed()`.

```{R, eval=FALSE}
#Set random seed
set.seed(1234)
#Randomly sample 12 of these numbers without replacement
sample(x = num_vec, size = 12, replace = FALSE)
#Reset random seed
set.seed(NULL)
```

Before we explain the code further, try running the cell multiple times.
If it is identical to the above code you will get the numbers "9, 5, 4, 3, & 6".

How come you are getting these results if it is random?

True randomness is pretty much impossible, especially in computing.
To get around this many programs use seeds to determine how random tasks will be carried out.
Various programs that use random seeds include:

- Sampling tools such as `sample()` and rarefaction
- Creating bootstrapped phylogenies
- Creating procedural content such as building Minecraft worlds

Therefore if you run a tool that will use randomness you will always get the same results if:

- You use the same random seed
- You use the same data
- You use the same replacement method (with or without)

In fact, run the below code in a new code cell and you may notice a similarity with your previous output.

```{R, eval=FALSE}
#Set random seed
set.seed(1234)
#Create a vector containing the numbers 0 to 10
larger_num_vec <- 10:19
#Randomly sample 5 of these numbers
sample(x = num_vec, size = 5)
#Reset random seed
set.seed(NULL)
```

That's right, `sample()` will always take the 10th (9/19), 6th (5/15), 5th (4/14), 4th (3/13), and 7th (6/16) values if it is given the random seed of (1234) and provided with a 11 length vector.

Setting our randomness is incredible beneficial for reproducibility in research.

When you carry out analysis you may need to redo some work. 
This could be due to reviewer comments or you want to incorporate some new methods.
As long as you saved the random seeds you used you can get the same results where you need to.
It also means others can replicate your results.

## Reset seed
<center>
![](figures/reset_seed.png){style="width:400px"}
</center>

We set a random seed at the start of the cell for reproducibility and control, but why do we then run the line `set.seed(NULL)`?

The normal operation of R means that, in effect, its random seed changes every time it is used.
This means R normally randomly determines randomness.
This is how it should be until we want to set the randomness.
It is therefore good practice to set the seed to `NULL` after you have utilised your set seeds.
This will revert the seed to its normal random operations.

One last point to note is R versions. 
Version 3.6 changed R's sampling methods, therefore if you use Version 3.5 or below you will get different results than we have got.
Hopefully the R developers will not change this in a later version again.

## Random seed practice

Brilliant! To reinforce the above knowledge try out the following challenges.

First create the following vector:

```{R, eval=FALSE}
second_millenium <- 1001:2000
```

__Note:__ Remember it is best practice to `set.seed(NULL)` at the end of a code cell.

### Random seed: Question 1

Sample the object `second_millenium` with the following parameters:

- Extract 10 values
- Without replacement
- Use the random seed `489`

```{r, echo = FALSE}
opts_p <- c("__1120__", answer="__1369__", "__1744__")
```
What is the fourth number in the produced vector? `r longmcq(opts_p)`

### Random seed: Question 2

Sample the object `second_millenium` with the following parameters:

- Extract 24 values
- Without replacement
- Use the answer to the first question as the random seed

```{r, echo = FALSE}
opts_p <- c("__1120__", "__1369__", answer="__1744__")
```
What is the 16th number in the produced vector? `r longmcq(opts_p)`

### Random seed: Question 3

Sample the object `second_millenium` with the following parameters:

- Extract a number of values equal to the answer of the second question
- With replacement
- Use the answer to the first question as the random seed

```{r, echo = FALSE}
opts_p <- c(answer="__1120__", "__1369__", "__1744__")
```
What is the 999th number in the produced vector? `r longmcq(opts_p)`

Once you are happy you can save then close and halt your "Random_seeds.ipynb" notebook.

Hopefully this has given you a good undertstanding of the principle of random seeds. With this you can continue onto iterative rarefaction.
