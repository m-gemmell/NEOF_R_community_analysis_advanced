# Family & Genus plots {#family_genus_chap}

In this chapter you will:

- Create Family plots by following example code.
- Be tasked to create Genus plots with little instruction.

I highly encourage you to copy previous code and edit it.
It is a major time saver.
However, it can be easy to overlook some edits.
It is a good idea to double check your edited code to ensure you have changed the relevant options, and object & file names.

## Family taxa plots

This part will show you a nice workflow for creating some family based taxa plots.
Run this at the bottom of your "3-taxonomy_barchart.ipynb" notebook.

### Aggregate families
<center>
![](figures/aggregate_taxa.png){style="width:200px; border-radius:15px; background:white"}
</center>

First we will create a `phyloseq` object by aggregating the families from the relative abundance `phyloseq` object.
We'll also check the family `phyloseq` object.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
#Family phyloseq
family_pseq <- microbiome::aggregate_taxa(pseq_relabund, "Family", verbose = FALSE)
#Head of family relative abundance table
head(phyloseq::otu_table(family_pseq))
#Number of families
paste0("Number of families: ", nrow(phyloseq::otu_table(family_pseq)))
#Summarise
microbiome::summarize_phyloseq(family_pseq)
microbiome::readcount(family_pseq)
```

We have 112 families. Quite a bit but hopefully they will all fit into a heatmap.

### Family heatmap
<center>
![](figures/heat_topology.png){style="width:200px"}
</center>

We will create a heatmap as before with one added `ggplot2` component.
As there are a lot of Families (112) and fewer samples (36) it will be easier to view if we have the families on the y-axis.
By default `microbiome::plot_composition()` will plot the taxa/families on the x-axis.
Thankfully we can use the `ggplot2()` function/component `coord_flip()` to flip/swap the x and y axes.

__Note__: The `xlab()` and `ylab()` are specified before this flipping.
E.g. `xlab()` is set to "Family" which will appear on the y axis because of the flip.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#Family heatmap
family_heatmap <- microbiome::plot_composition(family_pseq, plot.type = "heatmap") +
  xlab("Family") + ylab("Sample") +
  ggtitle("Family relative abundance heatmap") +
  #Flip the x and y axes
  coord_flip()
#Save ggplot object as png file
ggsave(filename = "./family_relabund_heatmap.png", plot = family_heatmap,
       device = "png", dpi = 300, units = "mm", height = 350, width = 200)
#Display the plot in jupyter notebook
IRdisplay::display_png(file="./family_relabund_heatmap.png")
```

The plot is quite large.
You can right click on the image and click "Open Image in New Tab" to view the whole image in a new tab.

With this heatmap we can see that the KBC and TSA samples have a high relative abundance of _Pseudomonadaceae_ whilst the TSA samples have a high relative abundance of _Aeromonadaceae_.
Additionally, we can see that a lot of families have relatively low relative abundances.

Once you are finished looking at the plot, close the tab containing the plot.
This will help to keep the used resources low on the cluster.
Next we'll carry out our rare aggregation and produce some bar charts.

### Family rare aggregation
<center>
![](figures/elephant_origami.png){style="width:200px"}
</center>

To aggregate our rare families we need to choose a suitable [detection and prevalence threshold](#aggregateraretaxa).
Generally, this is a process of trial and error trying to get a total of 12 taxa.
Twelve is a good number as it is the total number of colours in the Paired palette from Colour brewer.
You may need more in your own analysis so it is not a hard limit.

Therefore, lets try out various thresholds and see how many families we get.
To get a good idea where to start we can get a summary of the mean relative abundance values of the families.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#Summary of row means (families) from the family otu table
summary(rowMeans(phyloseq::otu_table(family_pseq)))
```

We have a lot of families so we will want to remove a good amount of them.
For our first attempt at rare aggregation we will use a detection value near the 3rd Quartile (0.0021601).
This will hopefully remove at least 3/4 of the families.

We'll set up the code a bit differently so we can easily copy and paste it to try out various other values of detection and threshold.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
#Tests
#1
d <- 0.002
p <- 5/100
test_pseq <- microbiome::aggregate_rare(
  pseq_relabund, level = "Family",
  detection = d, prevalence = p
)
paste0("Detection = ", d, ", Prevalence = ", p,
       ", Number of families = ", nrow(phyloseq::otu_table(test_pseq)))
```

That gives us 56 families which is too high for a nice visualisation. We'll therefore try a bunch of trial and error to get 12 families after aggregation.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
#2 Increase prevalence threshold
d <- 0.002
p <- 10/100
test_pseq <- microbiome::aggregate_rare(
  pseq_relabund, level = "Family",
  detection = d, prevalence = p
)
paste0("Detection = ", d, ", Prevalence = ", p,
       ", Number of families = ", nrow(phyloseq::otu_table(test_pseq)))
#3 Increase detection threshold
d <- 0.005
p <- 10/100
test_pseq <- microbiome::aggregate_rare(
  pseq_relabund, level = "Family",
  detection = d, prevalence = p
)
paste0("Detection = ", d, ", Prevalence = ", p,
       ", Number of families = ", nrow(phyloseq::otu_table(test_pseq)))
#4 Increase detection threshold
d <- 0.02
p <- 10/100
test_pseq <- microbiome::aggregate_rare(
  pseq_relabund, level = "Family",
  detection = d, prevalence = p
)
paste0("Detection = ", d, ", Prevalence = ", p,
       ", Number of families = ", nrow(phyloseq::otu_table(test_pseq)))
#5 Increase prevalence threshold
d <- 0.02
p <- 20/100
test_pseq <- microbiome::aggregate_rare(
  pseq_relabund, level = "Family",
  detection = d, prevalence = p
)
paste0("Detection = ", d, ", Prevalence = ", p,
       ", Number of families = ", nrow(phyloseq::otu_table(test_pseq)))
#Remove unwanted test_pseq
rm(test_pseq)
```

Super! 
A Detection threshold of 0.02 and a prevalence threshold of 20/100 gives us 12 families.
We'll now create a new `phyloseq` object using this info in a new cell.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
#Aggregate families
family_rareaggregate_pseq <- microbiome::aggregate_rare(
  pseq_relabund, level = "Family",
  detection = 0.02, prevalence = 20/100
)
```

Choosing a good detection and prevalence threshold is quite difficult.
It takes a lot of trial and error, and I find the thresholds to not be very intuitive to understand.
One piece of advise is to only change one threshold at a time during your trial and errors.

### Family bar chart
<center>
![](figures/chocolate_bar.png){style="width:200px"}
</center>

With our family rare aggregated `phyloseq` object we'll create a bar chart.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#Plot
family_bar <- 
  microbiome::plot_composition(family_rareaggregate_pseq,
                               #otu.sort to sort family by abundance
                               otu.sort = "abundance", group_by = "media") +
  xlab("Sample") + ylab("Relative abundance") +
  ggtitle("Family relative abundance bar chart") +
  #Change colours of families to that of the "Paired" palette from colour brewer
  scale_fill_brewer("Family", palette = "Paired")
#Save ggplot object as png
ggsave(filename = "./family_relabund_rareaggregate.png", plot = family_bar,
       device = "png", dpi = 300, units = "mm", height = 200, width = 300)
#Display the plot in jupyter notebook
IRdisplay::display_png(file="./family_relabund_rareaggregate.png")
```

Brilliant, we are now finished with the Family taxa plots. Onto something harder.

## Genus taxa plots
<center>
![](figures/ginger.png){style="width:200px"}
</center>

In this section you are running your own analysis for the Genus information in the "3-taxonomy_barchart.ipynb" notebook.
Carry out the following tasks with the relative abundance `phyloseq` object (`pseq_relabund`):

- Create an aggregated genus `phyloseq` object and summarise it (no rare aggregation).
- Create a heatmap of the genera relative abundances.
- Carry out genus rare aggregation so the resulting `phyloseq` object only contains 12 genera.
- Use the rare aggregated `phyloseq` object to create a bar chart grouped by __media__.

In essence you are going through the workflow for the family data but for genus instead.
Again, I encourage you to copy, paste, and edit previous code.
You will most likely need to change names of objects and also change various options.

### Genus taxa plots solutions
<center>
![](figures/ginger_solutions.png){style="width:200px"}
</center>

Please give the task a good try before looking at the solutions in the expandable boxes.
However, if you are really stuck or want to compare your code to mine please have a look.
Please, remember that there are many ways to do the same thing.
If your code is different but it works and you understand it then that is fine.
