In the next 4 chapters we will carry out diversity analyses. This will include calculating and visualising diversity values plus carrying out the associated statistics.

In the chapters we will carry out:

- [Rarefaction of our ASV table.](#rarefaction_chap)
- [Alpha diversity of the rarefied data.](#alpha_chap)
- [Beta diversity of the rarefied data.](#beta_chap)
- [Biomarker detection.](#DA_chap)

During this we will attempt to answer our questions from [Chapter 2](#sum_and_qs):

- How does the bacterial communities change across the anthropisation gradient?
- Is there a difference in the replicates of one site and media combination. I.e. do any of the media produce inconsistent profiles.
- Is there more difference between the sites or the media used?
- Do any of the media produce a similar taxonomic profile to the environmental sample?
