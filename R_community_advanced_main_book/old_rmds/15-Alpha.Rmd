# Alpha diversity {#alpha_chap}

In this chapter we are going to produce alpha diversity plots and statistics with our rarefied data.
Alpha diversity is carried out by producing a metric for each sample.
These metrics are primarily interested in the evenness or diversity of a sample.

Generally, these metrics are carried out on the ASV data to see the most fine grain differences between samples.
However, you can also use different taxa levels which we will show later on.
This can be useful if there is too much difference in the ASVs from sample to sample or you can only accurately classify sequences to a high level taxonomy (such as with `KRAKEN2` output).

Once we have a value for each sample they can be used to compare samples and sample groups.
Box plots are used for visualisation.
Statistics are used to determine if there is a significant difference between groups.

We'll start out by producing a basic box plot and statistics.
Next we'll improve the plot with some extra R packages.
With these tools we will compare the metrics across the various metadata fields we have.

## Alpha: setup
<center>
![](figures/gear_setup.png){style="width:200px"}
</center>

We will use a new notebook called **"5-alpha_diversity.ipynb"**. 
Add the following to the top of this new notebook to load the required libraries/packages and data.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#Libraries
library("phyloseq")
library("microbiome")
library("IRdisplay")
library("ggforce")
#Load phyloseq object
load("phyloseq_rarefied.RData")
```

Reminder to use markdown and code cells in the notebook.

## Alpha: simple plot
<center>
![](figures/simple_boxplot.png){style="width:200px; border-radius:15px; background:white"}
</center>

The first step is to calculate and plot the alpha diversity metrics based on the ASV data.
Thankfully, the command `phyloseq::plot_richness()` will do both of these.
Try it out.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
#Simple alpha plot
alpha_plot <- phyloseq::plot_richness(physeq = pseq_rarefy)
#Save ggplot object as png file
ggsave(filename = "./alpha_div.png", plot = alpha_plot,
       device = "png", dpi = 300, units = "mm", height = 200, width = 300)
#Display the plot in jupyter notebook
IRdisplay::display_png(file="./alpha_div.png")
```

The resulting plot is pretty good but is difficult to read. 
We can do 3 major things to make the contents easier to read.

### Metric choice
<center>
![](figures/metric_square_1.png){style="width:200px"}
</center>

We can choose certain alpha diversity metrics to plot. 
Currently it is showing 7 metrics (Observed, Chao1 etc.).
I like to use:

- __Observed__: This is the number of observed features (ASVs, Genera, etc) in each sample.
- __Chao1__: This is an estimate number of the total number of features in each sample.
- __Shannon__: A measure of diversity where a higher number means higher diversity. Shannon's index accounts for both abundance and evenness of the features present.

We'll choose these metrics with the `measures = ` option.
Either make a new code block with new code or you can edit and run the previous code you wrote.

```{r , eval = FALSE}
#Simple alpha plot
alpha_plot <- phyloseq::plot_richness(physeq = pseq_rarefy, measures = c("Observed","Chao1","Shannon"))
#Save ggplot object as png file
ggsave(filename = "./alpha_div.png", plot = alpha_plot,
       device = "png", dpi = 300, units = "mm", height = 200, width = 300)
#Display the plot in jupyter notebook
IRdisplay::display_png(file="./alpha_div.png")
```

To see which measures are available you can see the help page of `phyloseq::plot_richness()`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
?phyloseq::plot_richness
```

For a list and full description of some of the metrics please see the [APPENDIX](#alpha_appendix).

### Sample grouping & box plot
<center>
![](figures/boxplots_groups.png){style="width:200px; border-radius:15px; background:white"}
</center>

The last plot looks a bit better.
To actually make them box plots we'll change the x axis so they are based on media rather than individual samples.

The `phyloseq::plot_richness()` function produces a `ggplot2` object.
To convert our dot plot into a box plot we can add the layer `geom_boxplot()` like with our [depth boxplots](#depth-boxplots).
This will combine samples from one media into one IQR box.

```{r , eval = FALSE}
#Box plot
phyloseq::plot_richness(physeq = pseq_rarefy, 
                        x = "media",
                        measures = c("Observed","Chao1","Shannon")) +
            ggplot2::geom_boxplot()
#Save ggplot object as png file
ggsave(filename = "./alpha_div.png", plot = alpha_plot,
       device = "png", dpi = 300, units = "mm", height = 200, width = 200)
#Display the plot in jupyter notebook
IRdisplay::display_png(file="./alpha_div.png")
```

### PNG height and width choice
<center>
![](figures/display_png.png){style="width:200px"}
</center>

Choosing a good height and width size can make plots easier to read.
We'll try 150 (height) and 250 (width).

```{r , eval = FALSE}
#Produce ggplot object of boxplot
alpha_boxplot <- phyloseq::plot_richness(physeq = pseq_rarefy, 
                        x = "media",
                        measures = c("Observed","Chao1","Shannon")) +
                          ggplot2::geom_boxplot()
#Save ggplot2 object with ggsave
ggsave(filename = "./Alpha_diversity_media_boxplot.png", plot = alpha_boxplot,
       device = "png", dpi = 300, units = "mm", height = 150, width = 250)
#Display plot
IRdisplay::display_png(file="./Alpha_diversity_media_boxplot.png")
```

How do I choose a good height and width?
This comes down to trial and error and experience.
You want something with a good aspect ratio for the plot and you want all the text to be clear.
Additionally, the size requirements of figures for journals will play a big consideration as well.
One of the nice things with creating jupyter-notebooks or R markdowns with all your code is that you can go back, edit, and rerun the code relatively easily and quickly.

## Alpha: stats
<center>
![](figures/pear.png){style="width:100px"}
</center>

Along with the plot it is also good to carry out statistical tests.
This will allow us to statistically determine if the alpha diversity values between groups are significantly different.

Before carrying out statistics we will need a data frame with the alpha diveristy values for each sample.
This can be carried out with the function`phyloseq::estimate_richness()`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#Produce data frame of all alpha diversity values
alpha_df <- phyloseq::estimate_richness(physeq = pseq_rarefy)
head(alpha_df)
```

We have all the alpha metrics in the new data frame.
Additionally, we also have the standard error for some of the metrics (e.g. `se.chao1`).

With this information we can carry out a pairwise comparison using Wilcoxon rank sum test (the same way as QIIME2).
Base R comes with the function `pairwsie.wilcox.test()` to carry this out.
We'll do this using media as our groups from the `sample_data()` and the Observed metric from the alpha_df.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#Paired wilcoxon test
#Observed
pairwise.wilcox.test(alpha_df$Observed, phyloseq::sample_data(pseq_rarefy)$media)
```

You can ignore the warning messages in this case.

Observe the results.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
opts_p <- c(answer="__Yes__", "__No__")
```
Are all the pairwise comparisons significant different (<0.05)? `r longmcq(opts_p)`

The test has carried out P value adjustments using the Holm-Bonferroni method (`P value adjustment method: holm`) which is good.

In this case the p-values are all identical as the values do not vary greatly but there are clear differences.
The only group with a large variance is the ENV group with values going from < 150 to > 450.

For more info on Wilcoxon test [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilcoxon_signed-rank_test) is a good start.

### Alpha stats task
<center>
![](figures/exercises.png){style="width:200px"}
</center>

Carry out the same statistical analysis (media as the grouping) with the `Chao1` and `Shannon` metrics.

`r hide("Alpha stats solution")`
```{r, eval=FALSE}
#Chao1
pairwise.wilcox.test(alpha_df$Chao1, phyloseq::sample_data(pseq_rarefy)$media)
#Shannon
pairwise.wilcox.test(alpha_df$Shannon, phyloseq::sample_data(pseq_rarefy)$media)
```
`r unhide()`

With these we can see that the differences between the Chao1 values of the different media are significantly different.

However, the p-values when comparing the Shannon values are not all significant.
The only significant differences are between ENV & KBC, and between KBC & TSA. 
Going back to the boxplot, does this look like the case?
I would say yes as the IQRs for CVP, KBC, and TSA all overlap.
There is little to no overlap of the IQRs of KBC and TSA against ENV.

We can therefore make these claims about the alpha diversity values of the groups.

- ENV has the highest number of observed ASVs and the highest diversity.
- ENV appears to have a wider range of diversities across its samples.
- The different culture media have much lower numbers of ASVs and diversity compared to ENV.
- Within each media grouping the samples have very similar numbers of ASVs present.

## Alpha diversity: violin plot
<center>
![](figures/violin.png){style="width:200px"}
</center>

Boxplots are quite nice but violin plots can be even nicer.
They show the distribution of the data in the IQR better and you can display each value.

We can change our boxplot to a violin plot by changing `ggplot2:geom_boxplot()` to `ggplot2::geom_violin()`.

Copy and paste the previous boxplot code to a new cell at the bottom of your notebook.
Edit and run the code so it looks like the below.

__Tip:__ Remember to change the name of your png file in the `ggsave()` and `IRdisplay::display_png()` functions.

```{r , eval = FALSE}
#Produce ggplot object of violin plot
alpha_violinplot <- phyloseq::plot_richness(physeq = pseq_rarefy, 
                        x = "media",
                        measures = c("Observed","Chao1","Shannon")) +
                          ggplot2::geom_violin()
#Save ggplot2 object with ggsave
ggsave(filename = "./Alpha_diversity_media_violinplot.png", plot = alpha_violinplot,
       device = "png", dpi = 300, units = "mm", height = 150, width = 250)
#Display plot
IRdisplay::display_png(file="./Alpha_diversity_media_violinplot.png")
```

We can also add semi transparent dots representing the values for each sample.
To do this, add the `ggplot2` layer `ggforce::geom_sina()`.
This has the option `alpha=0.5` where alpha represents the transparency of the dots and 0.5 represents 50% transparency.
Alpha is a common option used for many plots.

```{r , eval = FALSE}
#Produce ggplot object of violin plot
alpha_violinplot <- phyloseq::plot_richness(physeq = pseq_rarefy, 
                        x = "media",
                        measures = c("Observed","Chao1","Shannon")) +
                          ggplot2::geom_violin() +
                          ggforce::geom_sina(alpha=0.5)
#Save ggplot2 object with ggsave
ggsave(filename = "./Alpha_diversity_media_violinplot.png", plot = alpha_violinplot,
       device = "png", dpi = 300, units = "mm", height = 150, width = 250)
#Display plot
IRdisplay::display_png(file="./Alpha_diversity_media_violinplot.png")
```

## Alpha: Site plots and statistics
<center>
![](figures/river.png){style="width:200px"}
</center>

With all the knowledge, skills, and code from this chapter carry out the following tasks:

- Produce a violin plot of Observed, Chao1, and Shannon with the Site groups.
- Carry out paired Wilcoxon test for Observed, Chao1, and Shannon with the Site groups.

`r hide("Alpha sites solution")`
```{r , eval = FALSE}
#Produce ggplot object of violin plot
alpha_violinplot <- phyloseq::plot_richness(physeq = pseq_rarefy, 
                        x = "site",
                        measures = c("Observed","Chao1","Shannon")) +
                          ggplot2::geom_violin() +
                          ggforce::geom_sina(alpha=0.5)
#Save ggplot2 object with ggsave
ggsave(filename = "./Alpha_diversity_site_violinplot.png", plot = alpha_violinplot,
       device = "png", dpi = 300, units = "mm", height = 150, width = 250)
#Display plot
IRdisplay::display_png(file="./Alpha_diversity_site_violinplot.png")
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#Paired wilcoxon test
#Observed
pairwise.wilcox.test(alpha_df$Observed, phyloseq::sample_data(pseq_rarefy)$site)
#Chao1
pairwise.wilcox.test(alpha_df$Chao1, phyloseq::sample_data(pseq_rarefy)$site)
#Shannon
pairwise.wilcox.test(alpha_df$Shannon, phyloseq::sample_data(pseq_rarefy)$site)
```
`r unhide()`

The plots and stats do not show anything particularly interesting in terms of site unfortunately.
There is too much difference caused by the media.
To view this we can add the option `aes(colour=media)` to `ggforce_sina()`.
This will colour the points by media.

If we only do this it will give us a legend with the title "colour".
We can fix this by adding the layer `ggplot2::labs(colour = "Media")`.

```{r , eval = FALSE}
# Produce ggplot object of violin plot
alpha_violinplot <- phyloseq::plot_richness(physeq = pseq_rarefy, 
                        x = "site",
                        measures = c("Observed","Chao1","Shannon")) +
                          ggplot2::geom_violin() +
                          ggforce::geom_sina(alpha=0.5, aes(colour=media)) +
                          ggplot2::labs(colour = "Media")
#Save ggplot2 object with ggsave
ggsave(filename = "./Alpha_diversity_site_violinplot.png", plot = alpha_violinplot,
       device = "png", dpi = 300, units = "mm", height = 150, width = 250)
#Display plot
IRdisplay::display_png(file="./Alpha_diversity_site_violinplot.png")
```

When you are happy you can close and halt the notebook.

## Alpha: summary
<center>
![](figures/sum_blue.png){style="width:200px"}
</center>

In this chapter we have created alpha diversity plots and run pairwise comparisons.
The biggest difference between samples is caused by the media choice which overwrites differences we can see between sites.
The environmental samples have much higher diversity samples than the media samples but this is expected.
