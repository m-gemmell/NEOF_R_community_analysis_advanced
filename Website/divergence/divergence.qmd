Divergence analysis is comparing the dissimilarity distances between (inter-) and within (intra-) groupings.
This allows us to more closely examine beta diversity.

Ordination analysis (PCoA, NMDS, etc.) allows us to determine if groups cluster separately by dissimilarity/biodiversity measures.
Divergence analysis allows us to determine:

- Intra-group divergence/homogeneity: Comparison of distances within a group compared to distances within other groups. 
- Inter-group divergence/heterogeneity: Comparison of dissimilarity distances between a group's samples and all other group's samples (inter-group distances) compared to other groups' inter-group distances.

To remember the difference between intra- and inter- I remember the intranet (network within an organisation) and the internet (network between organisation).
More information about intra- and inter-divergence are in their specific sections.
