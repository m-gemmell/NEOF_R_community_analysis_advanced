We will create violin plots with [`ggplot2`](https://neof-workshops.github.io/Tidyverse/ggplot2/ggplot2.html) similar to the plots we created in the [Alpha diversity chapter of our R community analysis workshop](https://neof-workshops.github.io/R_community_whqkt8/Course/15-Alpha.html#alpha-diversity-violin-plot).

For this we need to create a [long tibble](https://neof-workshops.github.io/Tidyverse/ggplot2/input_data.html).
To carry this out we will:

- Load in the distance matrix
- Create a long [tibble](https://neof-workshops.github.io/Tidyverse/tibble/tibble.html) from the lower triangle
- Create a long [tibble](https://neof-workshops.github.io/Tidyverse/tibble/tibble.html) from the upper triangle
- Bind the [tibble](https://neof-workshops.github.io/Tidyverse/tibble/tibble.html)

However, before that let's see an example square distance matrix and long data frame for divergence analysis.

`r hide("What's a tibble?")`
A tibble is a reimagining of the data.frame object. It is part of the tidyverse suite of packages these materials extensively use. For more information please see: [Tidyverse Tibble guide](https://neof-workshops.github.io/Tidyverse/tibble/tibble.html)
`r unhide()`

## Square distance matrix
<center>
![](images/distance_matrix.png){style="width:150px; background: white; border-radius:5px"}
</center>

Our initial dissimilarity distance data is in a square distance matrix. An example is below:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
#Columns
S1 <- c(0,2,3)
S2 <- c(2,0,5)
S3 <- c(3,5,0)
mat <- as.matrix(data.frame(S1,S2,S3))
colnames(mat) <- c("S1","S2","S3")
row.names(mat) <- c("S1","S2","S3")
mat
```

There are three main sections to this distance matrix.

### Lower triangle
<center>
![](images/distance_matrix_lower_tri.png){style="width:150px; background: white; border-radius:5px"}
</center>

The lower triangle is the bottom left triangle of unique values.

For example (ignore the NAs):

```{r, echo = FALSE}
#Columns
S1 <- c(NA,2,3)
S2 <- c(NA,NA,5)
S3 <- c(NA,NA,NA)
mat <- as.matrix(data.frame(S1,S2,S3))
colnames(mat) <- c("S1","S2","S3")
row.names(mat) <- c("S1","S2","S3")
mat
```

### Upper triangle
<center>
![](images/distance_matrix_upper_tri.png){style="width:150px; background: white; border-radius:5px"}
</center>

The upper triangle is the top right triangle of unique values.

For example (ignore the NAs):

```{r, echo = FALSE}
#Columns
S1 <- c(NA,NA,NA)
S2 <- c(2,NA,NA)
S3 <- c(3,5,NA)
mat <- as.matrix(data.frame(S1,S2,S3))
colnames(mat) <- c("S1","S2","S3")
row.names(mat) <- c("S1","S2","S3")
mat
```

### Diagonal
<center>
![](images/distance_matrix_diagonal.png){style="width:150px; background: white; border-radius:5px"}
</center>

The diagonal represents the distances of each sample to itself. These are always zero.

For example (ignore the NAs):

```{r, echo = FALSE}
#Columns
S1 <- c(0,NA,NA)
S2 <- c(NA,0,NA)
S3 <- c(NA,NA,0)
mat <- as.matrix(data.frame(S1,S2,S3))
colnames(mat) <- c("S1","S2","S3")
row.names(mat) <- c("S1","S2","S3")
mat
```

## Long distance tibble
<center>
![](images/long_distance_tibble.png){style="width:150px; background: white; border-radius:5px"}
</center>

When the above example distance matrix is converted into a [long tibble](https://neof-workshops.github.io/Tidyverse/ggplot2/input_data.html) for divergence analysis it will then look like:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
Sample_L <- c("S1","S1","S2","S2","S3","S3")
Sample_R <- c("S2","S3","S1","S3","S1","S2")
Value <- c(2,3,2,5,3,5)
long_df <- tibble::tibble(Sample_L, Sample_R, Value)
long_df
```

Some of the features of this long [tibble](https://neof-workshops.github.io/Tidyverse/tibble/tibble.html) are:

- The "Value" column is the distance between the two samples
- Each observation/row has a "Sample_L" and "Sample_R" column to represent the 2 samples the distance is between
    - The "L" and "R" represent Left and Right. Left/Right has no significant meaning and instead was chosen as the Right samples are right to the Left samples in the [tibble](https://neof-workshops.github.io/Tidyverse/tibble/tibble.html).
- We do not include the 0 values from the diagonal.
- Each value is represented twice, i.e. the lower and upper triangle values are included.
    - The 2 rows containing the duplicated values are different in which sample is the Left sample and which is the right sample.
    - This is required for creating inter-group divergence (explained later)

As an example of duplicated values the below data frame shows the distance between S1 and S2 twice. 
Notice that S1 is the Left sample in the first row but it is the Right sample in the other row.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
long_df[c(1,3),]
```

With theory covered let's move onto practice.
