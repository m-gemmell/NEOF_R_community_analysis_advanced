# Lower triangle

Our first formatting step is to create a long data frame of the dissimilarity values in the lower triangle of the dissimalirty matrix.

## Dissimialrity matrix

Before we start, ensure you have loaded the phyloseq object and dissimilarity matrix as shown in [data and setup page](/divergence/data_and_setup.qmd).

Once it is loaded we can view the top 10 rows and columns of the matrix.

```{r eval = FALSE}
#Check first 10 rows and columns of beta dissimilarity matrix
beta_df_mean[1:10,1:10]
```
