# Setup

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
#R code block that does nothing so the engine used is knitr for this page
#Other wise non python code blocks don't display the code properly (i.e. the bash code block below)
```

## Workshop directory

Create and move into a new directory in your home directory called "adv_R_comm".

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
mkdir ~/adv_R_comm
cd ~/adv_R_comm
```
