We'll create another upset plot with two main differences.

- It will display the intersection of the phyla sets against sample grouping.
- We'll create and run one pipeline that goes from the ASV abundance phyloseq object to an upset plot.

Read through, type, and run the code.
Ensure you understand how it all works before continuing.

Please feel free to copy, paste, and edit previous code to create the below code.
This code will then be useful for copy, pasting, and editing to create further plots.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#Upset plot of phyla intersections with sample groupings
phyla_samples_upset_plot <- pseq |>
    #Convert abundances to relative/compositional abundances
    microbiome::transform("compositional") |>
    #Aggregate ASVs to phylum level
    microbiome::aggregate_taxa("Phylum", verbose = FALSE) |>
    #Extract phyla relative abundance table
    phyloseq::otu_table() |>
    #Extract otu_table as a tibble
    microbiome::otu_tibble(column.id = "Phylum") |>
    #Longify tibble
    tidyr::pivot_longer(!Phylum, names_to="Sample", values_to="Abundance") |>
    #Filter out rows were relative abundance is 0
    #i.e. retain rows showing presence
    dplyr::filter(Abundance > 0) |>
    #Select to remove unwanted Abundance column
    dplyr::select(-Abundance) |>
    #Group tibble by the Sample (grouping) column
    dplyr::group_by(Sample) |>
    #Summarise the Phylum (sets) column
    #Results in each row having a unique sample
    # with a list of the intersection of present phyla
    dplyr::summarize(Phyla = list(Phylum)) |>
    #ggplot
    #Phyla (intersection) column as the x aesthetic
    ggplot2::ggplot(aes(x = Phyla)) +
        #Bar chart
        ggplot2::geom_bar() +
        #Upset scale on x axis
        ggupset::scale_x_upset() + 
        #Y label
        ggplot2::labs(y="Sample count")
#Save plot to png file
ggplot2::ggsave(filename = "./phyla_intersection_sample_group_upset.png", 
                plot = phyla_samples_upset_plot,
                device = "png", dpi = 300, units = "mm", height = 200, width = 300)

The above plots shows the number of samples (groups) with in specific phyla (set) intersections.
The total sample count in the bar chart is equal to the total sample count of our data.

#### MCQs

Great! With the upset plot answer the below yes/no MCQs.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
opts_p <- c("__Yes__", answer="__No__")
```
1. Is there at least one sample that contains all the phyla? I.e. is there an intersection of all the phyla in the plot? `r longmcq(opts_p)`

```{r, echo = FALSE}
opts_p <- c("__Yes__", answer="__No__")
```
2. Are there any samples that only have one phyla present? I.e. is there an intersection of one phyla (set) displayed on the plot?  `r longmcq(opts_p)`

```{r, echo = FALSE}
opts_p <- c(answer="__Yes__", "__No__")
```
3. Is there a total of 7 samples where Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes are the only phyla present? I.e is the intersection of Proteobacteria + Firmicutes + Bacteroidetes found in 7 samples?  `r longmcq(opts_p)`

```{r, echo = FALSE}
opts_p <- c("__Yes__", answer="__No__")
```
4. Is there a total of 7 samples where Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria are the only phyla present? I.e is the intersection of Proteobacteria + Firmicutes + Bacteroidetes + Actinobacteria found in 7 samples?  `r longmcq(opts_p)`

```{r, echo = FALSE}
opts_p <- c("__Yes__", answer="__No__")
```
5. Is Firmicutes found in all the samples? I.e. is Firmicutes in all the displayed intersections? `r longmcq(opts_p)`

```{r, echo = FALSE}
opts_p <- c(answer="__Yes__", "__No__")
```
6. Is Proteobacteria found in all the samples? I.e. is Proteobacteria in all the displayed intersections? `r longmcq(opts_p)`

Using the fact that there are 36 samples attempt the following MCQs:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
opts_p <- c("__2__", "__26__", answer="__34__")
```
7. How many samples is Firmicutes present in? I.e. what is the total sample count of all the intersections Firmicutes is found in?  `r longmcq(opts_p)`

```{r, echo = FALSE}
opts_p <- c("__2__", answer="__26__", "__34__")
```
8. How many samples is Bacteroidetes present in? I.e. what is the total sample count of all the intersections Bacteroidetes is found in? `r longmcq(opts_p)`

```{r, echo = FALSE}
opts_p <- c(answer="__2__", "__26__", "__34__")
```
9. How many samples is Tenericutes present in? I.e. what is the total sample count of all the intersections Tenericutes is found in? `r longmcq(opts_p)`
